## Installation

Download or git clone this repo and then go to project folder and run below commands to install node_modules.

```bash
    npm run dev
```

Now, Do any changes in css or js you would like to do in this repo. All HTML Files are inside ./pages folder. Open main.scss and save this file once if classes added to HTML doesn't work and Wait for compilation to complete, Okay ? Did it worked ?
